This project aims to predict user churn in the Waze app using machine learning techniques. It comprises five notebooks, each focusing on a different aspect of the data analysis process:

- Notebook 1 - Data Understanding: Investigates and organizes the provided Waze dataset, including creating a pandas dataframe, compiling summary information about the data, and examining key variables.

- Notebook 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducts exploratory data analysis on the dataset, including data cleaning, building visualizations, and evaluating and sharing results.

- Notebook 3 - Hypothesis Testing: Performs a two-sample hypothesis test (t-test) to analyze the difference in the mean amount of rides between iPhone and Android users, communicating insights with stakeholders.

- Notebook 4 - Logistic Regression Model: Performs exploratory data analysis and builds a binomial logistic regression model to predict user churn, evaluating model performance and interpreting results.

- Notebook 5 - Random Forest and XGBoost Models: Implements Random Forest and XGBoost models to identify factors driving user churn, providing recommendations for next steps and model comparison.

Each notebook plays a crucial role in understanding the data, conducting analysis, building models, and providing insights to stakeholders regarding user churn in the Waze app.
