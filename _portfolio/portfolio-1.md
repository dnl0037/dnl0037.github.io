### Notebooks Overview

1. **Inspect and Analyze Data**
    - This notebook investigates and understands the provided taxi cab dataset, including creating a pandas dataframe, performing a cursory inspection, and compiling summary information about the data.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
    - Conducts exploratory data analysis on the dataset, including data cleaning, building visualizations, and evaluating and sharing results.

3. **Hypothesis Testing**
    - Demonstrates knowledge of hypothesis testing by analyzing whether there is a relationship between payment type and fare amount, using descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing in Python.

4. **Multiple Linear Regression Model**
    - Builds a multiple linear regression model to predict fare amount, evaluating model performance and interpreting results.

5. **Random Forest and XGBoost Models**
    - Implements Random Forest and XGBoost models to predict whether a customer is a generous tipper, considering ethical implications and recommending adjustments to the model objective if necessary.

### Importance of Each Notebook

Each notebook plays a crucial role in understanding the data, conducting analysis, building models, and providing insights regarding fare prediction and customer tipping behavior in New York City taxi cab rides.
