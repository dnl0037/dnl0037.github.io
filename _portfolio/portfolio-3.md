This project aims to classify each video according to whether it presents a claim or an opinion. It comprises five notebooks, each focusing on a different aspect of the data analysis process:

- Notebook 1 - Data Understanding: Initiates the exploration of the provided TikTok dataset by acquainting with the data, compiling summary information, and preparing for further analysis.

- Notebook 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducts exploratory data analysis on the TikTok dataset, focusing on factors that differentiate claim videos from opinion videos.

- Notebook 3 - Hypothesis Testing: Demonstrates knowledge of hypothesis testing by applying descriptive and inferential statistics, probability distributions, and hypothesis testing in Python.

- Notebook 4 - Logistic Regression Model: Builds a logistic regression model to predict user churn and evaluates its performance using exploratory data analysis techniques.

- Notebook 5 - Random Forest and XGBoost: Implements Random Forest and XGBoost models to automate the initial stages of the claims process on TikTok, predicting whether a video presents a "claim" or an "opinion."

Each notebook plays a crucial role in understanding the data, conducting analysis, building models, and providing insights regarding claim classification on TikTok.
