## Project Overview

This project aims to classify each video on TikTok according to whether it presents a claim or an opinion. The project is hosted on GitHub Pages. To view the project, [click here](https://dnl0037.github.io/TikTok-ML/). If you're interested in exploring the source code, you can find it [here](https://github.com/dnl0037/TikTok-ML/).

### Notebooks Overview

1. **Data Understanding**
   - Initiates the exploration of the provided TikTok dataset by acquainting with the data, compiling summary information, and preparing for further analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Conducts exploratory data analysis on the TikTok dataset, focusing on factors that differentiate claim videos from opinion videos.

3. **Hypothesis Testing**
   - Demonstrates knowledge of hypothesis testing by applying descriptive and inferential statistics, probability distributions, and hypothesis testing in Python.

4. **Logistic Regression Model**
   - Builds a logistic regression model to predict user churn and evaluates its performance using exploratory data analysis techniques.

5. **Random Forest and XGBoost**
   - Implements Random Forest and XGBoost models to automate the initial stages of the claims process on TikTok, predicting whether a video presents a "claim" or an "opinion."

### Importance of Each Notebook

Each notebook plays a crucial role in understanding the data, conducting analysis, building models, and providing insights regarding claim classification on TikTok.
