### Notebooks Overview

1. **Data Understanding**
    - Investigates and organizes the provided Waze dataset, including creating a pandas dataframe, compiling summary information about the data, and examining key variables.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
    - Conducts exploratory data analysis on the dataset, including data cleaning, building visualizations, and evaluating and sharing results.

3. **Hypothesis Testing**
    - Performs a two-sample hypothesis test (t-test) to analyze the difference in the mean amount of rides between iPhone and Android users, communicating insights with stakeholders.

4. **Logistic Regression Model**
    - Performs exploratory data analysis and builds a binomial logistic regression model to predict user churn, evaluating model performance and interpreting results.

5. **Random Forest and XGBoost Models**
    - Implements Random Forest and XGBoost models to identify factors driving user churn, providing recommendations for next steps and model comparison.

### Importance of Each Notebook

Each notebook plays a crucial role in understanding the data, conducting analysis, building models, and providing insights to stakeholders regarding user churn in the Waze app.
