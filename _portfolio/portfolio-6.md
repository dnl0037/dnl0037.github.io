## Project Overview

This project implements several classification algorithms for machine learning tasks, specifically for sentiment analysis. It is part of the "Machine Learning with Python - From Linear Models to Deep Learning" course offered by MIT. The project is hosted on GitHub Pages.

### Algorithms Overview

1. **Perceptron Algorithm**
    - Updates classification parameters based on a single step and iterates through the dataset multiple times to converge to an optimal solution.

2. **Average Perceptron Algorithm**
    - Similar to the Perceptron algorithm but computes the average of the parameters over multiple iterations, leading to a more stable model.

3. **Pegasos Algorithm**
    - Optimizes linear classifiers using stochastic gradient descent, incorporating a regularization term to prevent overfitting.

## Bag of Words (BoW)

Bag of Words (BoW) is a technique used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to represent text data. It treats each document as a collection of words, ignoring grammar and word order. This representation is useful for tasks like text classification and sentiment analysis.
